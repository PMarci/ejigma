### interactive mode

1. reintroduce status bar
     1. remove logback as feedback source
1. look into fullscreen mode
1. set offsets
     1. think about how to accomplish nice wheel-like UI for it
     1. multithreaded blinking?
1. make keymap more intuitive and flexible
    1. make keymap configurable
    1. print help reflecting config
1. print help at beginning
1. option to print auto entry/reflector for portability
     1. maybe do something sneaky for "security"
     1. option to print entire armature state
1. handle WINCH and resize correctly
1. ability to handle newlines in buffer
1. move up and down in buffer
1. taint and recalculation
1. some sort of cache for recalculation (optionally?), depends of speed for realistic loads

### non-interactive mode

1. find standard/established way of handling parameters
    1. some self-documented help option
1. composite config sources? cli params + settings?
    1. are settings files even needed?
1. file reading and writing? maybe superfluous because of redirection
1. load armature state from file
    1. basically (de)serialization
    1. think about "security" implications

### general

1. fully implement PlugBoard
    1. implement interactive setting of plugboard
1. get new name (rotor stream cypher something something, YARSCE?)
1. remove Spring and handle lifecycles like a big boy
    1. develop some alternative to the bean registry
    1. some container binding Armature and Plugboard
    1. using Properties API
    1. JNDI?
1. create an API-like version for use in a web service for example
    1. maybe with single top level object like so many others
    1. think about what could be reused for typex, lorenz
1. what's an Uhr?
    1. include every model and scrambler under the sun for brownie points
    1. compatibility considerations beyond alphabetString
1. cryptanalysis features
1. think about delivery, installation (man pages?)

### issues

* in windows terminal WSL2, switching anything using the selectionreader
breaks arrow key navigation at the `readBinding() - getBound()` level  
* works in CMD, presumably PS
